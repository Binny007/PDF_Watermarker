# PDF_Watermarker

We have created a python program to make any pdf files to have a waermark as 'Draft' copy.
--> for this project i have used 'wtr.pdf' file which have watermark.
--> Then a 'super.pdf' file which has no watermark in it.

Then I have merged the pages of both files using #mergePage and added watermark to all pdf files
--> The output file is 'watermarked_output.pdf'
--> And 'watermark.py' file which have source code
.

Heads up!

In order to make sure your code works just like mine, I recommend you install the same version as me. To do this, make sure you type in your command line:

pip3 install PyPDF2==1.26   --> for the file 'wateramrk.py'
.
.
If you DO want to use the latest version of PyPDF2, then here is the code difference you will see
.
.
pip3 install PyPDF2    -->  for the file 'wateramrk2.py'(because this will install the latest)

# PDF_Watermarker

We have created a python program to make any pdf files to have a waermark as 'Draft' copy.
--> for this project i have used 'wtr.pdf' file which have watermark.
--> Then a 'super.pdf' file which has no watermark in it.

Then I have merged the pages of both files using #mergePage and added watermark to all pdf files
--> The output file is 'watermarked_output.pdf'
--> And 'watermark.py' file which have source code
